# ACF Dynamic Shortcodes

**ACF Dynamic Shortcodes** is a lightweight WordPress plugin that lets you dynamically register shortcodes for [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) attached to a specific page — without writing a single line of code.

> Perfect for custom pricing pages, dynamic content blocks, and personalised shortcodes mapped to ACF fields.

## Features

- Admin settings panel to select an ACF source page
- Auto-detects ACF fields from the selected page
- Create custom shortcode names for each field
- Copy-to-clipboard buttons for easy reuse
- Editable value overrides directly from the plugin UI
- Syncs edited values back to the ACF field itself
- Fallback message when value is missing
- Works with both ACF Free and Pro

## Example Usage

If you have a custom field called `starting_price`, and you assign it a shortcode like:

`[price]`

You can then use that shortcode anywhere on your WordPress site — pages, posts, or builders — and it will automatically output the ACF field value from your selected source page.
